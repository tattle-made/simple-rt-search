- [Request Access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfb248JGhHziFQ3YfE9CYYWkF5vb_zlUn1bpmbjpy8aVGbw7g/viewform) to our publicly hosted Kosh
- Launch Kosh on your own machine (guide)[docs/development.md]

## Pair programming

We offer pair programming sessions with community members to familiarize them with the product and the code base. This will give you an opportunity to clarify any doubts regarding the codebase and the features that interest you.

Once you have a local instance of Kosh running, you can make the changes you want to the code. Test the features and add appropriate documentation for it if needed.

# 📞 Tell us

All code changes happen via pull request. We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). The easiest way to let us know if you want to combine your changes into the core code is to make a Pull Request (PR)

In your PR, please mention the following :

- What does this PR do?
- How do we test this PR?

We don't strictly follow test driven development (TDD) but any contributions that include tests are greatly appreciated.

# 🎉 Celebrate
